The representation of time is complex, in part because the domain is
intrinsically complicated, and in part because we mean by "time" is
different in different contexts. _Aviation_ is an attempt to rationalize this
complexity by providing immutable representations of a variety concepts
relating to time and operations between them, taking advantage of the
opportunities Scala offers to make these APIs as intuitive as possible.
